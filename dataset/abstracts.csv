" For readability assessment, traditional methods mainly employ machine learning classifiers with hundreds of linguistic features. Although the deep learning model has become the prominent approach for almost all NLP tasks, it is less explored for readability assessment. In this paper, we propose a BERT-based model with feature projection and length-balanced loss (BERT-FP-LBL) for readability assessment. Specially, we present a new difficulty knowledge guided semi-supervised method to extract topic features to complement the traditional linguistic features. From the linguistic features, we employ projection filtering to extract orthogonal features to supplement BERT representations. Furthermore, we design a new length-balanced loss to handle the greatly varying length distribution of data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on two English benchmark datasets and one dataset of Chinese textbooks, and also achieves the near-perfect accuracy of 99\% on one English dataset. Moreover, our proposed model obtains comparable results with human experts in consistency test.

"            Document classification is a challenging task with important applications. The deep learning approaches to the problem have gained much attention recently. Despite the progress, the proposed models do not incorporate the knowledge of the document structure in the architecture efficiently and not take into account the contexting importance of words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms for document classification tasks. The main contribution of this work is the use of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, generalizable and abstract features by the hierarchical representation. The proposed method in this paper improves the results of the current attention-based approaches for document classification.

"            We present a semi-supervised learning framework based on graph embeddings.
Given a graph between instances, we train an embedding for each instance to
jointly predict the class label and the neighborhood context in the graph. We
develop both transductive and inductive variants of our method. In the
transductive variant of our method, the class labels are determined by both the
learned embeddings and input feature vectors, while in the inductive variant,
the embeddings are defined as a parametric function of the feature vectors, so
predictions can be made on instances not seen during training. On a large and
diverse set of benchmark tasks, including text classification, distantly
supervised entity extraction, and entity classification, we show improved
performance over many of the existing models.

"            This paper explores a simple and efficient baseline for text classification.
Our experiments show that our fast text classifier fastText is often on par
with deep learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, and many orders of
magnitude faster for training and evaluation. We can train fastText on more
than one billion words in less than ten minutes using a standard multicore~CPU,
and classify half a million sentences among~312K classes in less than a minute.

"            We experiment with COVID-Twitter-BERT and RoBERTa models to identify informative COVID-19 tweets. We further experiment with adversarial training to make our models robust. The ensemble of COVID-Twitter-BERT and RoBERTa obtains a F1-score of 0.9096 (on the positive class) on the test data of WNUT-2020 Task 2 and ranks 1st on the leaderboard. The ensemble of the models trained using adversarial training also produces similar result.

"            Text embeddings are commonly evaluated on a small set of datasets from a single task not covering their possible applications to other tasks. It is unclear whether state-of-the-art embeddings on semantic textual similarity (STS) can be equally well applied to other tasks like clustering or reranking. This makes progress in the field difficult to track, as various models are constantly being proposed without proper evaluation. To solve this problem, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). MTEB spans 8 embedding tasks covering a total of 58 datasets and 112 languages. Through the benchmarking of 33 models on MTEB, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of text embeddings to date. We find that no particular text embedding method dominates across all tasks. This suggests that the field has yet to converge on a universal text embedding method and scale it up sufficiently to provide state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks. MTEB comes with open-source code and a public leaderboard at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.

"            This paper describes VICTOR, a novel dataset built from Brazil{'}s Supreme Court digitalized legal documents, composed of more than 45 thousand appeals, which includes roughly 692 thousand documents{---}about 4.6 million pages. The dataset contains labeled text data and supports two types of tasks: document type classification; and theme assignment, a multilabel problem. We present baseline results using bag-of-words models, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and boosting algorithms. We also experiment using linear-chain Conditional Random Fields to leverage the sequential nature of the lawsuits, which we find to lead to improvements on document type classification. Finally we compare a theme classification approach where we use domain knowledge to filter out the less informative document pages to the default one where we use all pages. Contrary to the Court experts{'} expectations, we find that using all available data is the better method. We make the dataset available in three versions of different sizes and contents to encourage explorations of better models and techniques.

"            Adverse drug reactions / events (ADR/ADE) have a major impact on patient health and health care costs. Detecting ADR's as early as possible and sharing them with regulators, pharma companies, and healthcare providers can prevent morbidity and save many lives. While most ADR's are not reported via formal channels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations such as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or CRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that detects ADR's in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced - one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for deciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is implemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on top of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions of batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.

"            With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.

"            The ability to automatically determine the age audience of a novel provides many opportunities for the development of information retrieval tools. Firstly, developers of book recommendation systems and electronic libraries may be interested in filtering texts by the age of the most likely readers. Further, parents may want to select literature for children. Finally, it will be useful for writers and publishers to determine which features influence whether the texts are suitable for children. In this article, we compare the empirical effectiveness of various types of linguistic features for the task of age-based classification of fiction texts. For this purpose, we collected a text corpus of book previews labeled with one of two categories -- children's or adult. We evaluated the following types of features: readability indices, sentiment, lexical, grammatical and general features, and publishing attributes. The results obtained show that the features describing the text at the document level can significantly increase the quality of machine learning models.

classification, such that the full model fits in a limited amount of memory.
After considering different solutions inspired by the hashing literature, we
propose a method built upon product quantization to store word embeddings.
While the original technique leads to a loss in accuracy, we adapt this method
to circumvent quantization artefacts. Our experiments carried out on several
benchmarks show that our approach typically requires two orders of magnitude
less memory than fastText while being only slightly inferior with respect to
accuracy. As a result, it outperforms the state of the art by a good margin in
terms of the compromise between memory usage and accuracy.

"            Language model (LM) pretraining can learn various knowledge from text corpora, helping downstream tasks. However, existing methods such as BERT model a single document, and do not capture dependencies or knowledge that span across documents. In this work, we propose LinkBERT, an LM pretraining method that leverages links between documents, e.g., hyperlinks. Given a text corpus, we view it as a graph of documents and create LM inputs by placing linked documents in the same context. We then pretrain the LM with two joint self-supervised objectives: masked language modeling and our new proposal, document relation prediction. We show that LinkBERT outperforms BERT on various downstream tasks across two domains: the general domain (pretrained on Wikipedia with hyperlinks) and biomedical domain (pretrained on PubMed with citation links). LinkBERT is especially effective for multi-hop reasoning and few-shot QA (+5% absolute improvement on HotpotQA and TriviaQA), and our biomedical LinkBERT sets new states of the art on various BioNLP tasks (+7% on BioASQ and USMLE). We release our pretrained models, LinkBERT and BioLinkBERT, as well as code and data at https://github.com/michiyasunaga/LinkBERT.

Pre-training is performed on OpenSubtitles: a large corpus of spoken dialog containing over $2.3$ billion of tokens. We demonstrate how hierarchical encoders achieve competitive results with consistently fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art models and we show their importance for both pre-training and fine-tuning.

"            Short text classification is a crucial and challenging aspect of Natural Language Processing. For this reason, there are numerous highly specialized short text classifiers. However, in recent short text research, State of the Art (SOTA) methods for traditional text classification, particularly the pure use of Transformers, have been unexploited. In this work, we examine the performance of a variety of short text classifiers as well as the top performing traditional text classifier. We further investigate the effects on two new real-world short text datasets in an effort to address the issue of becoming overly dependent on benchmark datasets with a limited number of characteristics. Our experiments unambiguously demonstrate that Transformers achieve SOTA accuracy on short text classification tasks, raising the question of whether specialized short text techniques are necessary.

"            Wide usage of social media platforms has increased the risk of aggression, which results in mental stress and affects the lives of people negatively like psychological agony, fighting behavior, and disrespect to others. Majority of such conversations contains code-mixed languages[28]. Additionally, the way used to express thought or communication style also changes from one social media plat-form to another platform (e.g., communication styles are different in twitter and Facebook). These all have increased the complexity of the problem. To solve these problems, we have introduced a unified and robust multi-modal deep learning architecture which works for English code-mixed dataset and uni-lingual English dataset both.The devised system, uses psycho-linguistic features and very ba-sic linguistic features. Our multi-modal deep learning architecture contains, Deep Pyramid CNN, Pooled BiLSTM, and Disconnected RNN(with Glove and FastText embedding, both). Finally, the system takes the decision based on model averaging. We evaluated our system on English Code-Mixed TRAC 2018 dataset and uni-lingual English dataset obtained from Kaggle. Experimental results show that our proposed system outperforms all the previous approaches on English code-mixed dataset and uni-lingual English dataset.

"            Real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution,with a few frequent labels and a lot of few-shot labels. The study of institution name normalization is a perfect application case showing this phenomenon. There are many institutions worldwide with enormous variations of their names in the publicly available literature. In this work, we first collect a large-scale institution name normalization dataset LoT-insts1, which contains over 25k classes that exhibit a naturally long-tailed distribution. In order to isolate the few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios from the massive many-shot classes, we construct our test set from four different subsets: many-, medium-, and few-shot sets, as well as a zero-shot open set. We also replicate several important baseline methods on our data, covering a wide range from search-based methods to neural network methods that use the pretrained BERT model. Further, we propose our specially pretrained, BERT-based model that shows better out-of-distribution generalization on few-shot and zero-shot test sets. Compared to other datasets focusing on the long-tailed phenomenon, our dataset has one order of magnitude more training data than the largest existing long-tailed datasets and is naturally long-tailed rather than manually synthesized. We believe it provides an important and different scenario to study this problem. To our best knowledge, this is the first natural language dataset that focuses on long-tailed and open-set classification problems.

We achieve an accuracy of 97.2{\%}, close to a 6 point improvement over the previous State of the Art of 91.6{\%}. Additionally, we believe that machine learning algorithms can be applied on top of this method to further improve accuracy.

Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.

"            In NLP, text classification is one of the primary problems we try to solve and its uses in language analyses are indisputable. The lack of labeled training data made it harder to do these tasks in low resource languages like Amharic.

In this short paper, we aim to introduce the Amharic text classification dataset that consists of more than 50k news articles that were categorized into 6 classes. This dataset is made available with easy baseline performances to encourage studies and better performance experiments.

"            Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a
fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common
fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words
features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and
they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, """"powerful,"""" """"strong"""" and
""Paris"""" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an
unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from
variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents.
Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to
predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the
potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results
show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other
techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art
results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.

"            Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.

"            In this paper, we propose a novel representation for text documents based on aggregating word embedding vectors into document embeddings. Our approach is inspired by the Vector of Locally-Aggregated Descriptors used for image representation, and it works as follows. First, the word embeddings gathered from a collection of documents are clustered by k-means in order to learn a codebook of semnatically-related word embeddings. Each word embedding is then associated to its nearest cluster centroid (codeword). The Vector of Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE) representation of a document is then computed by accumulating the differences between each codeword vector and each word vector (from the document) associated to the respective codeword. We plug the VLAWE representation, which is learned in an unsupervised manner, into a classifier and show that it is useful for a diverse set of text classification tasks. We compare our approach with a broad range of recent state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we obtain a considerable improvement on the Movie Review data set, reporting an accuracy of 93.3%, which represents an absolute gain of 10% over the state-of-the-art approach.

"            The emergence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has shown great success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks including text classification. Due to the minimal to no feature engineering required when using these models, PLMs are becoming the de facto choice for any NLP task. However, for domain-specific corpora (e.g., financial, legal, and industrial), fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task has shown to provide a performance improvement. In this paper, we compare the performance of four different PLMs on three public domain-free datasets and a real-world dataset containing domain-specific words, against a simple SVM linear classifier with TFIDF vectorized text. The experimental results on the four datasets show that using PLMs, even fine-tuned, do not provide significant gain over the linear SVM classifier. Hence, we recommend that for text classification tasks, traditional SVM along with careful feature engineering can pro-vide a cheaper and superior performance than PLMs.

"            A common bottleneck in deploying supervised learning systems is collecting human-annotated examples. In many domains, annotators form an opinion about the label of an example incrementally--e.g., each additional word read from a document or each additional minute spent inspecting a video helps inform the annotation. In this paper, we investigate whether we can train learning systems more efficiently by requesting an annotation before inspection is fully complete--e.g., after reading only 25 words of a document. While doing so may reduce the overall annotation time, it also introduces the risk that the annotator might not be able to provide a label if interrupted too early. We propose an anytime active learning approach that optimizes the annotation time and response rate simultaneously. We conduct user studies on two document classification datasets and develop simulated annotators that mimic the users. Our simulated experiments show that anytime active learning outperforms several baselines on these two datasets. For example, with an annotation budget of one hour, training a classifier by annotating the first 25 words of each document reduces classification error by 17% over annotating the first 100 words of each document.

By modifying existing NLP tasks, we create a diverse benchmark which requires models to successfully model long-term dependencies in the text. We evaluate how existing models perform, and find that our benchmark is much more challenging than their `short document' equivalents.

We try to clarify the reasons for the sub-optimal performance of LLMs understanding negation. We introduce a large semi-automatically generated dataset of circa 400,000 descriptive sentences about commonsense knowledge that can be true or false in which negation is present in about 2/3 of the corpus in different forms. We have used our dataset with the largest available open LLMs in a zero-shot approach to grasp their generalization and inference capability and we have also fine-tuned some of the models to assess whether the understanding of negation can be trained. Our findings show that, while LLMs are proficient at classifying affirmative sentences, they struggle with negative sentences and lack a deep understanding of negation, often relying on superficial cues. Although fine-tuning the models on negative sentences improves their performance, the lack of generalization in handling negation is persistent, highlighting the ongoing challenges of LLMs regarding negation understanding and generalization. The dataset and code are publicly available.

"            There is a growing interest in understanding how humans initiate and hold conversations. The affective understanding of conversations focuses on the problem of how speakers use emotions to react to a situation and to each other. In the CL-Aff Shared Task, the organizers released Get it #OffMyChest dataset, which contains Reddit comments from casual and confessional conversations, labeled for their disclosure and supportiveness characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a predictive ensemble model exploiting the finetuned contextualized word embeddings, RoBERTa and ALBERT. We show that our model outperforms the base models in all considered metrics, achieving an improvement of $3\%$ in the F1 score. We further conduct statistical analysis and outline deeper insights into the given dataset while providing a new characterization of impact for the dataset.

"            Unstructured technical texts are a rich resource of engineering knowledge underutilised for data analysis. Maintenance work orders (MWO), for example, capture valuable information to inform what work was done on an asset and why. Data in MWO short text fields is unstructured, terse and jargon-rich, complicating the ability of both humans and machines to read it. Our challenge is to efficiently extract technical information from the MWO short text field and combine it with data in structured fields such as dates, functional location, make and model of the asset. In this paper we present a technical language processing-based solution for this problem. Echidna is an intuitive query-enabling interface that visualises historic asset data in the form of a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph is produced by MWO2KG, which uses deep learning supported by annotated training data to automatically construct knowledge graphs from unstructured technical text combined with data from structured fields. The tools are tested on maintenance work order and delay accounting data provided by industry partners. These tools provide reliability engineers with an efficient way to find information in historic asset data for failure modes and effects analysis, maintenance strategy validation and process improvement work. Source code for both tools is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License.

"            This work focuses on in-context data augmentation for intent detection. Having found that augmentation via in-context prompting of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) alone does not improve performance, we introduce a novel approach based on PLMs and pointwise V-information (PVI), a metric that can measure the usefulness of a datapoint for training a model. Our method first fine-tunes a PLM on a small seed of training data and then synthesizes new datapoints - utterances that correspond to given intents. It then employs intent-aware filtering, based on PVI, to remove datapoints that are not helpful to the downstream intent classifier. Our method is thus able to leverage the expressive power of large language models to produce diverse training data. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can produce synthetic training data that achieve state-of-the-art performance on three challenging intent detection datasets under few-shot settings (1.28% absolute improvement in 5-shot and 1.18% absolute in 10-shot, on average) and perform on par with the state-of-the-art in full-shot settings (within 0.01% absolute, on average).

"            This paper describes our results for TRAC 2020 competition held together with the conference LREC 2020. Our team name was Ms8qQxMbnjJMgYcw. The competition consisted of 2 subtasks in 3 languages (Bengali, English and Hindi) where the participants{'} task was to classify aggression in short texts from social media and decide whether it is gendered or not. We used a single BERT-based system with two outputs for all tasks simultaneously. Our model placed first in English and second in Bengali gendered text classification competition tasks with 0.87 and 0.93 in F1-score respectively.

"            Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models (LLMs) on particular datasets is a commonly employed strategy in Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification tasks. However, this approach usually results in a loss of models generalizability. In this paper, we present a framework that allows for maintaining generalizability, and enhances the performance on the downstream task by utilizing task-specific context attribution. We show that a linear transformation of the text representation from any transformer model using the task-specific concept operator results in a projection onto the latent concept space, referred to as context attribution in this paper. The specific concept operator is optimized during the supervised learning stage via novel loss functions. The proposed framework demonstrates that context attribution of the text representation for each task objective can improve the capacity of the discriminator function and thus achieve better performance for the classification task. Experimental results on three datasets, namely HateXplain, IMDB reviews, and Social Media Attributions, illustrate that the proposed model attains superior accuracy and generalizability. Specifically, for the non-fine-tuned BERT on the HateXplain dataset, we observe 8% improvement in accuracy and 10% improvement in F1-score. Whereas for the IMDB dataset, fine-tuned state-of-the-art XLNet is outperformed by 1% for both accuracy and F1-score. Furthermore, in an out-of-domain cross-dataset test, DistilBERT fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset in conjunction with the proposed model improves the F1-score on the HateXplain dataset by 7%. For the Social Media Attributions dataset of YouTube comments, we observe 5.2% increase in F1-metric. The proposed framework is implemented with PyTorch and provided open-source on GitHub.

"            One-hot CNN (convolutional neural network) has been shown to be effective for
text categorization (Johnson & Zhang, 2015). We view it as a special case of a
general framework which jointly trains a linear model with a non-linear feature
generator consisting of `text region embedding + pooling'. Under this
framework, we explore a more sophisticated region embedding method using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM can embed text regions of variable (and possibly
large) sizes, whereas the region size needs to be fixed in a CNN. We seek
effective and efficient use of LSTM for this purpose in the supervised and
semi-supervised settings. The best results were obtained by combining region
embeddings in the form of LSTM and convolution layers trained on unlabeled
data. The results indicate that on this task, embeddings of text regions, which
can convey complex concepts, are more useful than embeddings of single words in
isolation. We report performances exceeding the previous best results on four
benchmark datasets.

"            While self-supervised learning has made rapid advances in natural language processing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in resource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law, puzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case Holdings On Legal Decisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second, we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books and Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (using corpus of approximately 3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than BERT's) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12% improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain specificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage resource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures, too, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language.
